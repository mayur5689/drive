# Hot Restart Required!

## The app is running old code. You need to restart it:

### Option 1: Hot Restart (Fastest)
1. Look at the Flutter terminal window
2. Press **`R`** (capital R) to hot restart
3. Wait for it to reload

### Option 2: Stop and Restart
1. Press **`q`** in the Flutter terminal to quit
2. Run again: `flutter run -d chrome`

### Option 3: Full Restart
1. Close the browser tab
2. Stop Flutter (Ctrl+C or press `q`)
3. Run: `flutter run -d chrome`

## After Restart:
- File upload will work on web (using bytes)
- Email verification message will show
- All null errors will be fixed
- Folder creation will work

**The fixes are in the code - just need to reload!**
